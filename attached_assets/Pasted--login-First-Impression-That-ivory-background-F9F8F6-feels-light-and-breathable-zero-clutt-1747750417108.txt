🔐 /login
First Impression:

That ivory background (#F9F8F6) feels light and breathable — zero clutter.

The navy buttons (#0F172A) = ✨ prestige + action. Feels serious but not aggressive.

Input fields with soft shadows + padding give it a smooth, inviting vibe.

Typography with charcoal text (#1F2937) — legible, modern, confident.

Feels like:

“I’m not just logging into a student portal… I’m entering a space that respects my time and data.”

📝 /register (Student)
Vibes:

Same classy canvas.

A bit of sage or muted gold (#C9B88C) on labels or icons? Nice subtle contrast.

Signup form looks trustworthy, not overly techy. You could imagine an Ivy League CS program using this.

Feels like:

“This platform was designed by someone who knows good UX, not someone who just copied Bootstrap defaults.”

🛡️ /admin/register
Secret code field? LOVE IT.

Adds a layer of exclusivity and security theater that just feels good for admins.

Bonus points if there's a lock icon or tooltip next to the secret code field.

Feels like:

“You’ve got to know someone to get in here. This ain’t Gmail.”

💻 /student/dashboard
Aesthetic Monaco Editor in a card? Fire.

The centered editor surrounded by white space = clean focus zone.

The gold/olive accents framing the coding question make the "Write a prime-checking function" feel important, not just “meh, another assignment.”

Dropdown + buttons = smooth interaction if they’re styled with the same button base.

Feels like:

“Minimalist coding dojo. No distractions. Just you, your thoughts, and the compiler.”

📊 /student/grades
Grade table in a polished box with muted borders = chef’s kiss.

Bonus: If each row uses gold/green badge chips for grades like “A”, “B”, etc., it adds visual hierarchy without noise.

Feels like:

“I trust this platform to represent my academic record. It’s clean, consistent, and doesn’t scream ‘built overnight’.”

🧑‍💼 /admin/dashboard
Viewing submissions in a table with soft beige rows and navy headers? That’s elegance.

Clicking to grade — if you have modals or popups with soft drop shadows — very product-like.

The “View Grades” section using dropdown search = great for fast reviews.

Feels like:

“I’m managing this lab session like an editor reviewing papers at The New Yorker.”
